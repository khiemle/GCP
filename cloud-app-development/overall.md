## Microservices

### Loosely coupled services

### Worker Pattern

### Continuous integration and delivery


## Best practice in Cloud Application development

### Code and environment management
* Code repository
* Dependency Management: jars file (do not put into the code repo)
* Configration settings: environment variable, key... don't put inside the code  base
* Consider to use Microservices: service boundaries match business boundaries...
* Use event driven processing
### Scalibility and Reliability

### Design and development

### Migration


## Install NodeJS

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -

sudo apt install nodejs

node <file.js>
